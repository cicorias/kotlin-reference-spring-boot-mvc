# Overview

## Plugin Management

See the article [Using Gradle Plugins # management](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/plugins.html#sec:plugin_version_management)

As in the article Plugin Versions are defined in the `gradle.properties` file, then the setting is applied through `settings.gradle.kts` using `plugingManagement` so it applies to the entire build.
